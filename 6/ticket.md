While on a year long sabbatical your bike was stolen. Fortunately, 
there was a camera pointed at it the entire time. In order to find
out who stole your bike you need to identify the frame that it was stolen.
You are given a function `is_bike_in_frame(n)` that will return `True`
if the bike is visible on frame `n` and `False` otherwise. Please
implement the function `find_bike` that returns the last frame in which
the bike is visible.
